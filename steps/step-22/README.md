# Create-React-App

Wow, we did a lot! I know you're all itching to create a front-end to talk to your back-end now. We'll be writing in React. This isn't a basic React course so I won't go into details on that. Maybe when I update the tutorial I'll give you some ideas how to do it.

### Step

1.  Hopefully you have installed `create-react-app` already. In the same project directory, go ahead and type in the terminal `create-react-app /client`. We are going to initialize a react project in the client folder.

2.  If you don't have `create-react-app` installed, run the command `npm install create-react-app -g`. The `-g` means it will install if globally so you can use it anywhere in the terminal.

3.  After you're done, let's `cd` into the `client` folder by typing `cd client` and then `npm start`. Let's load our react app!
