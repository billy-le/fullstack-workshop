# Installing Node.js

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

### Steps

1.  Go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install the LTS (Long-term Support) for your platform.

2.  Then in the terminal, type in `node -v` to check the version you downloaded and installed matches the version printed in the terminal.

3.  Navigate to this directory in the terminal and run the program app.js by typing `node app.js`.

4.  You should see `Your node is working properly!` in your terminal. You have correctly installed Node!
