# How to Use This Workshop

You should see two folders in this project, `final` and `steps`. The `final` folder contains the completed app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Express.

You should also see a `server.js` that has one line of comment. This is where you will write your code and invoke in the terminal to run your server.

In the `steps` folder, you will see a list of separate folders in `step-xx-title` where `step-xx` is the step sequence and the `title` is a quick reference on where to go if you need to refer to that specific step.

Each `step` folder contains a `README.md` file that talks you through the steps and hopefully it is easy for you to follow.

Other than that, that's about it! I hope you enjoy this workshop and I'll keep it up-to-date with the latest tech.
